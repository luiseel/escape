As his former assistant, you have followed his research OMNI-H, or as he called it, what cures everything.\n\nYour days are numbered. With cancer expanding throughout all your body, you decide to take someone's life in order to preserve yours.\n\nYour mission is simple, find the antidote that will save your life... but keep your eyes open.
